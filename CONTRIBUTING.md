# Contributing to Indexed Bitvector

If you'd like to contribute code to this library your first step should be
to open an issue on the [github project](https://github.com/DarkOtter/indexed-bitvec-rs)
to discuss a contributing process with me. As I am so far the only contributor,
and likely to remain so, I haven't made one yet. I will not be able to accept
contributions without discussion.
